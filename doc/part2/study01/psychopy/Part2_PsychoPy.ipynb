That's just how often you can change something on a screen. The implication is that you **cannot** present a stimulus for 20 or 25 ms, for example. Not good your taste?

    "It depends on your specific experiment. For long stimulus presentation times (hundreds of miliseconds), it's okay to use `core.Clock` because you probably don't need milisecond precision and it's more user-friendly. But for short durations (tens of miliseconds) or when you care about precise timing you should go with frame-based timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to consider is a slightly different behavior of the two. Clock-based timing will always end exactly the specified amount of miliseconds after it started. Frame-based timing, on the other hand, will present the exact number of frames that you asked for. The more frames you ask for, the more likely it is that some will be dropped, meaning that several frames will be drawn not a for a single duration of a frame (e.g., 16.667 ms) but for twice as long. Since the amount of frames is fixed, the total duration of a trial will consequently be longer by that amount. This is unlikely to happen when you have only several frames presented but if you try to present stimulus for 8 sec using frame-based timing, you may get slightly longer stimulus durations. In many cases, that doesn't matter. But in fMRI experiments where stimulus onset must be time-locked to the onset of a scanner sequence, this may lead to an unacceptable desynchronization."

    "This approach is useful in scenarios where trials occur non-stop, i.e. there is no waiting for user response. For example, in fMRI experiments, trial onsets must be time-locked such that their onsets are in sync with scanner. In such paradigms we want to make sure that a trial ends just in time. Now you may think that it does so with **event.waitKeys** too (since we set `maxWait=.5`) but the harsh truth is that this waiting starts only *after* stimuli are drawn. So if it took the computer 20 ms to draw the stimuli, the total trial duration will be 520 ms instead of 500 ms. These tiny offsets accumulate quickly so one idea is to constantly check trial and global timing using these while-loops and end as soon as necessary as counted from the *beginning* of a trial. So I find the while-loop approach to be more robust so in our experiment we use this method."
